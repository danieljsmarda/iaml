# Introductory Applied Machine Learning: University of Edinburgh
These are the projects I completed during my Introductory Applied Machine Learning course at the University of Edinburgh in Edinburgh,
Scotland, UK in Fall 2016. Ideas and concepts behind some portions of the assignments were discussed with classmates as noted, but the code (except where noted by the
professor) was written entirely by me.

## Topics by Assignment
* Assignment 1: Tool introduction (NumPy/Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn); Naive Bayes Classification to classify the category of news articles based word prevalence
* Assignment 2: Simple and Multivariate Linear Regression to predict automobile price based on physical characteristics; K-fold cross-validation and evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, CC)
* Assignment 3: Object recognition based on visual word features using Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Support Vector Classifiers
* Assignment 4: Kmeans clustering 20 Newsgroups dataset based on tf-idf weights; Dimensiionality reduction of MNIST images using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
