These are the projects I completed during my 
Introductory Applied Machine Learning course
at the University of Edinburgh in Edinburgh,
Scotland, UK in Fall 2016. 

Ideas and concepts behind some portions of the
assignments were discussed with classmates as
noted, but the code (except where noted by the
professor) was written entirely by me.
